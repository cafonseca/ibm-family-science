The program has evolved over 30 years and was developed by scientists at IBM who believe that science should be fun! This local educational outreach program is normally taught at IBM Research Headquarters location in Yorktown, New York. The objectives are to show children that science is part of everyday life and to help foster their interest in learning. Children work together with their parents and IBM researchers on science experiments covering several topics including:

* Kitchen Chemistry
* States of Matter
* Polymer Science
* Electronics
* Algorithms
* Waves

During Covid, many children were home due to school closures.  The IBM Family Science team of IBM Research volunteers worked hard to bring this program to IBM families and to hundreds of external students â€“ by running virtual sessions.
