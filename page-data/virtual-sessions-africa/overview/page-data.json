We will have a test on 14 July to ensure all schools and students can join.  All Sessions start at 11:00 PM GMT.\n\nIBM Families, please visit #family_science slack channel for registration information. External students, please register through your school.\n\nPlease see the tab on this website “Prep and Presentations” for the preparation instruction for each class. If you don’t have time to prepare - join us anyway and have fun learning about science!\n\nFor questions, please contact Tamara.Govindasamy@ibm.com.\n\n## Details and schedule\n\nThis hands-on science program is offered by IBM Research and has been developed by IBM scientists who believe that science should be fun! These sessions have been taught for 30 years and we are excited to bring them to Africa and the Middle East!\n\nThe IBM instructors worked hard to turn the classes into a virtual interactive session, covering a series of topics.  During these sessions, the scientists engage with the students and the students can ask questions as well. We encourage parents or teachers to join the sessions along with the students, but it is not a requirement. These classes are recorded in case a student is not able to join on the date/time we offer a specific topic. Each session will be approximately 90 mins long and further program details are provided in the table below. You are welcome to join the sessions up to 15 minutes before the start time to ensure good connectivity.\n\n| Date | Time in GMT | Topic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 14 July 2023 | 13:00 PM (15:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Connectivity test</h4> This session will be for testing your ability to join and interact during the sessions.<br /><br /> For queries, please contact your school’s tech support, or join the following support group:<br /><br />WhatsApp: <br />https://chat.whatsapp.com/IYDW659a7ij8L0begPa2KJ |\n| 22 July 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Why science is important for girls and boys</h4> Explore the opportunity to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Math - talk to some of our scientists about what inspired them, how they got started and what they love about their jobs.|\n| 29 July 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Kitchen chemistry</h4>Learn about the periodic table, states of matter and have fun experimenting in the kitchen!|\n| 5 August 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Computers, programming, and robotics</h4> In these classes you will learn how computers are made and how they work on the inside.
