Learn about coding fundamentals and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world. |\n| 5 August 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Kitchen chemistry</h4>Learn about the periodic table, states of matter and have fun experimenting in the kitchen!|\n| 12 August 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Waves and quantum</h4> This introduction to waves will help you understand how standing waves shape the world around us. Classical physics is what we experience in our everyday lives. If you were to shrink down to the subatomic world - this is the domain of quantum physics.|\n\n## Photos\n\n![tempImageImJvnt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b85bbb1-38fb-497b-a570-7695b9a5a231) <br/>\n![tempImageMqO4I2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797e17d6-0566-4891-816e-8c7fe888ad2e) <br/>\n![tempImageOaQsTR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/238380d4-e1e1-4a66-9180-907c70b33201) <br/>\n![tempImageMkp9hr](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1695822-2610-4c56-99c7-9da38a1c53dc) <br/>\n![tempImageGoLIYE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9ce1f0-5c11-4833-b9e9-b2070e9b04a9) <br/>\n![tempImagelTd2K8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0dae4cd-1d49-4c49-ada9-01313eb4d5ee) <br/>\n![tempImagewd6LxQ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8599f2df-e5f3-48b8-b15e-676f207a930f) <br/>\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6a245f6a77fd74d7ca534d56b0c2b482","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":194},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Overview\n---\n\n## For families across the Middle East and Africa\n\nThis hands-on science program is offered by IBM Research and has been developed by IBM scientists who believe that science should be fun!
